        <p style="font-size:3vh;">Joining the team from soloing as <a href="http://www.darkhorsedp.com">DarkHorseDP</a> Shawna is a heavy-hitting Technologies Generalist with a creative side. Out of high school she enlisted in the US Navy, successfully completing the Navy’s (and perhaps the US military’s) most difficult educational program, The Nuclear Power Program. After the Navy she got her Bachelor’s of Science and worked for Frito-Lay/ Pepsi-Co as a sugars and oils chemical analyst and High Performance Liquid and Gas Chromatographer. After Frito-Lay, she lived and worked in Japan for 3 years as a highly responsible head instructor for an all Japanese Kindergarten, building out entire year long curriculums... while she learned Japanese! Upon returning to America in 2016, she started her career in software, first doing quality assurance for both hardware and software for cash-counting smart safes and then consulted for Lehigh Hanson, a subsidiary of Heidelberg Cement group, a multi-billion Euro German multinational. She broke into web development and design in 2018 after learning the ropes with hands-on experience in both small and large lean, Agile, fast-paced environments. She is also a self-published poet.

        Shawna brings a passion for developing with ASP.NET Core, various ‘front end’ technologies and is a very talented creative and technical writer. She also enjoys customer engagement and project management. In the JavaScript realm she enjoys AJAX, jQuery and vanilla JavaScript and after learning of Svelte, she immediately realized its potential and quickly became passionate for it. With her QA background, she brings high quality workmanship, development, light graphic design work, technical writing and copywriting to the table.

        Her favorite ice cream is anything from Tillamook and she likes the outdoors.
